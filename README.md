# EatDaBurgerDa Sequel

### Overview

In this assignment, we created a burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and Sequelize.

### Application

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users add burgers that they would like to eat to the Menu.

* When a user enters the name of a burger, it appears in the left column under "Menu."

* Each burger on the Menu has an `Eat It!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page under "Devoured."

* Every burger entered is stored in MySQL.
